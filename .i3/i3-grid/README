INTRODUCTION

  i3-grid is a python script that organizes i3 Window Manager workspaces into
  a customizable grid. It can be run from the command line or bound to hotkeys
  through the i3 configuration file. It is primarily developed for Linux, but
  may support BSD or other Unix systems as well.

DEPENDENCIES

  Python 2 OR Python 3

    i3-grid is written in python, and it supports both Python 2 and Python 3
    syntax. The python interpreter must be linked to the python command.

  i3 Window Manager

    i3-grid accesses the i3 Window Manager through the i3-msg interface.

INSTALLATION

  Install with

    sh ./install.sh

  and uninstall with

    sh ./uninstall.sh

  Both of these require root privileges, and install.sh must be run from the
  root directory of this repository. Note that i3-grid is generally installed
  to /usr/bin/i3-grid, so installation will fail if that file already exists.

  To use i3-grid with hotkeys, add the following to the i3 configuration file
  for each hotkey:

     bindsym <key> exec i3-grid <command>

USAGE

  i3-grid <command>
